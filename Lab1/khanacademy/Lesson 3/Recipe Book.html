    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Brew strong espresso (300 ml) and leave it to cool. <br>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Wash eggs (6 pcs.) thoroughly in warm water and soap.
      Carefully separate the whites from the yolks.
      It is important that not a drop of yolk gets into the whites, otherwise the whites will not whip.
      We put the whites in the refrigerator for now, we will need them later.
      Add sugar (150 g) to the yolks. <br>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Beat the yolks with sugar until the mixture turns white, this may take a few minutes.
      You may have some undissolved sugar left, but if there is not too much of it, don’t worry, it will dissolve later. If there is a lot of sugar left, beat the mixture some more.
      <br>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Place the whipped yolks with sugar in a large container, add mascarpone (500 g) there.
      Gently mix the yolks with sugar and mascarpone with a spatula until smooth.
      Look how thick the mixture turns out; if it turns out liquid, most likely the problem is in the mascarpone. <br>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Place the whipped whites into the mixture with the yolks and mascarpone.
      Now you can’t use a mixer; you need to work carefully, otherwise the cream may lose its airiness.
      Using a spatula, mix the cream in a circular motion from bottom to top, i.e. lift the cream from the bottom of the dish to the top. <br>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Pour the cooled coffee into a flat-bottomed container that fits a Savoyardi stick.
      A small plastic container works very well here. If you are making Tiramisu with cognac, then add cognac (30-50 g) to the coffee.
      We immerse each Savoyardi stick in coffee and immediately take it out. Place the coffee-soaked sticks on the bottom of the mold.
      Place about half of the cream on top of the Savoyardi layer and level it out.
      Place a second layer of coffee-soaked cookies on top of the cream. <br>
      <strong>Step 7:</strong> Spread the remaining cream on top, smooth it out and put it in the refrigerator for several hours, or better yet, overnight.
      The longer you keep Tiramisu in the refrigerator, the better the cream will hold its shape. After a few hours, you will still not be able to take a neat piece of dessert out of the mold; you can only eat it with a spoon, although this will not affect the taste in any way.
      After 8-10 hours, Tiramisu will hold its shape much better and you will be able to cut out a beautiful piece. <br>
